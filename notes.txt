once migrations are done, 
Tasks models wont be seen on admin panel cos we've to register 
the models in django admin panel. 
-do this in apps, admin file.

for class bases views, 
1st 
from django.views.generic.list import ListView

inheriting into the view class, the ListView has all the fucntions of ListView.
returns back a template with queries set of data

import the view class into urls and call .as_view()(from inherited views) since urlpatterns doesnt take class 
but only functions. 

by default django ListView looks for template <modelname>_list.html, 
if not exclusively defined, and passes object as object_list by default 

DetailView - more info on an item 
.views.generic.detail DetailView

TaskDetail(DetailView)->looks for <modelname>_detail.html
one object at a time instead of whole list. by primary_key
view by default looks for pk in url, primary key value in path, so set as int
